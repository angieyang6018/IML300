### Other Chrome extension concepts I am interested in creating
* Concept 1: An extension that allows you to quickly save an image to a chrome folder instead of dragging it onto your desktop to save it
* Concept 2: An extension that counts down your screentime, will have notifications depending on the time limit the user set
* Concept 3: An extension that, when enabled, will randomly change words on the webpage
* Concept 4: An extension that generates a random phrase followed by a random noun, username generator
