      <h1>Thoughts</h1>
      <a>- What are some good and bad aspects of having a website?</a><br>
      <a>- Do you think the internet and the environment it's created today is what people from decades ago imagined? If not, what do you think their idealization of internet would look like?</a><br>
      <a>- One popular belief against the internet is that it leaves us with no privacy. What is your position on this issue?</a><br>
      <a>- What does the black 'gooey' thing represent in the context of the article?</a><br>
      <a>- Compare and contrast HCI and UX? How does the 'experience' play out in the context of the two?</a><br>
      <a>- How do we usually perceive information on a screen? How did this contribute to some of the design choices we make?</a><br>
      <a>- Do you think the advancing technology in DNA and identification is a good thing or a bad thing?</a><br>
      <a>- How have surveillance and the public eye changed over the years?</a><br>
      <a>- Do you think future machines and AI will be able to predict everything in our lives?</a><br>
